                </li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>We learned many things like Java,Html and CSS.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>We learned how to make websites fit on difffernt apps which I thought was really cool.  </li>
                <br>
                <br> 
                <li>We've done many interactive projects that have been really fun and rewarding.</li>

                <li>My freshman year I took Mr.Dals class.</li>
                <br> 
                <br>
                <li>We did nothing in the class and just wrote what was on the board and I thought that was really boring.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>It really made  me not like programming until this year.
